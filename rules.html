    <p id="rule-text">
      The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular sound when
      it is pressed or activated. A round in the game consists of the game
      lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player
      must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses,
      the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
